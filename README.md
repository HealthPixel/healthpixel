# HealthPixel
HealthPixel is a web application designed to streamline the process of accessing and updating patient medical records. The platform enables healthcare professionals to quickly retrieve a patientâ€™s medical history, update records in real time, and ensure that patient data remains secure and accessible.

## Features
1. Quick Access to Patient Records
Healthcare professionals can quickly access a patient's complete medical history by entering their unique ID into HealthPixel, allowing for informed decision-making without needing the patient to recount their medical history.

2. Patient Data Privacy
HealthPixel prioritizes patient data privacy, ensuring that only authorized healthcare professionals can access medical records. The platform employs secure authentication, and audit logs (in view) to maintain confidentiality.

3. Updating Patient Records
After consultations or treatments, healthcare professionals can easily update patient records with new test results, diagnoses, or treatments. This ensures that the latest medical information is always available for future visits.

4. Real-Time Patient Access
Patients can securely view their medical information in real time through unique, secure links provided by healthcare professionals. This feature eliminates the need for a traditional login interface while maintaining data security.

## Installation
__Clone the repository:__
```
git clone https://github.com/HealthPixel/healthpixel.git
```
```
cd healthpixel
```

__Install dependencies:__
All dependencies that would be needed by the application are all in the **requirement.txt**. Use the command below to install them.
```
pip install -r requirement.txt
```

__Set up the database:__
- You need to have a MySQL server running in your terminal to store the db, If you don't have it you can follow this article to install it. [How to install mysql on Ubuntu 20.04](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-mysql-on-ubuntu-20-04)
(change the distribution or Ubuntu version to the one you're running)
- Once your MySQL server is installed and running, you need to make sure `root` authenticates with a password by using either the `mysql_native_password` or `caching_sha2_password` authentication plugin (the article explains how to do that)

__Create a MySQL database and configure the connection settings in the set_env_var file:__
```
sudo mysql -u root -p < setup_mysql_db.sql
source env_setup
```
__Start the application:__
```
python3 -m api.v1.app
```

## Usage
Once the application is up and running, healthcare professionals can log in using their credentials to access patient records, update information, and manage patient data. Patients can view their records using secure links provided by their healthcare providers.

# HealthPixel
HealthPixel is a web application designed to streamline the process of accessing and updating patient medical records. The platform enables healthcare professionals to quickly retrieve a patientâ€™s medical history, update records in real time, and ensure that patient data remains secure and accessible.

## Features
1. Quick Access to Patient Records
Healthcare professionals can quickly access a patient's complete medical history by entering their unique ID into HealthPixel, allowing for informed decision-making without needing the patient to recount their medical history.

2. Patient Data Privacy
HealthPixel prioritizes patient data privacy, ensuring that only authorized healthcare professionals can access medical records. The platform employs secure authentication, and audit logs (in view) to maintain confidentiality.

3. Updating Patient Records
After consultations or treatments, healthcare professionals can easily update patient records with new test results, diagnoses, or treatments. This ensures that the latest medical information is always available for future visits.

4. Real-Time Patient Access
Patients can securely view their medical information in real time through unique, secure links provided by healthcare professionals. This feature eliminates the need for a traditional login interface while maintaining data security.

## API Endpoints
HealthPixel offers a set of RESTful API endpoints for managing patient records, user authentication, and data access:

__Authentication__

- POST /api/auth/login - Authenticate healthcare professionals.
- POST /api/auth/logout - Log out of the system.

__Patient Management__
